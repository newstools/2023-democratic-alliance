Note to editors: Please find attached soundbite by Tsepo Mhlongo MP. The DA is disappointed by the decision taken today by the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture, Beauty Dlulane, to not allow the DA to present a petition with more than 11 000 signatures against the Mzansi National Philharmonic Orchestra (MNOP). The decision, which was apparently based on technicalities and ANC tactics, delayed the revelation of more than 11 000 peopleâ€™s opposition to the MNOP and our call for an investigation into the R54 million project to the committee. The DA will present the petition at the next portfolio committee meeting and request a parliamentary investigation into the wasteful expenditure which is the Mzansi National Philharmonic Orchestra. We will be relentless in our opposition to the project until it is scrapped.
