Please find attached a soundbite by Andrew Whitfield MP. The DA has written to Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, to highlight the imminent threat posed to the economy, public and private infrastructure, as well as the safety of citizens, by the Economic Freedom Fighters’ job killing National Shutdown on 20 March. South Africa’s fragile economy cannot withstand a national shutdown which will cripple struggling small businesses and leave many more people unemployed. The EFF’s dangerous and violent political tactics are an attack on the livelihoods of hard working, law abiding South Africans and are an attack on our democracy. Increasingly violent and threatening rhetoric surrounding this shutdown reveals that the EFF is prepared to wilfully break the law and place the lives and the safety of citizens at risk through their actions. An EFF leader in Mpumalanga recently posted a picture of himself holding a fully automatic rifle with the following comment: “By all means necessary or possible we are ready”. The DA has brought this example of threatening rhetoric to the attention of Minister Cele so he cannot turn a blind eye to the imminent threat. The DA has called on Minister Cele and the SAPS to issue a strong statement clearly stating their position on the National Shutdown and also to assure South Africans that the SAPS and the entire security cluster is on standby to respond to violence. The violent unrest of July 2021 took the SAPS by surprise. This time they have been forewarned and should therefore be forearmed to preempt, prevent and respond to any threats of violence or efforts to destabilise the country. South Africans must stand up and stand together against EFF-sponsored lawlessness and fascism. In 2024 we have an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to constitutional democracy by turning our backs on destructive populism of the EFF.
