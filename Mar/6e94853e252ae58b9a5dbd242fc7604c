Note to editors: Please find attached soundbite by Mat Cuthbert MP. The DA encourages members of the public to bid for “Lottopreneur” and award-winning actress, Terry Pheto’s former house which has gone on auction today. According to the advertisement placed for the auction it is a “luxurious spacious home comprising of: 3 Bedrooms 2 Bathrooms Kitchen Open plan dining room with family room Lounge 3rd Bedroom can be used as a Study/Office Large roof top garden with entertainment area Double garage It should also be noted that the home is in “excellent” condition. Please see the attached link for your reference: https://online.assetauctions.co.za/items/view/4-8ZPOM3/3-bedroom-upmarket-home-in-bryanston Despite her initial “dismay” at the revelation that she had unduly benefitted from lotteries funding meant for culturally sensitive medical intervention projects, the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has stated that she and her legal team have chosen not to oppose the preservation order. The proceedings instituted by the SIU are an ongoing process to recover ill-gotten gains and the DA is strongly in support of this. However, we call on the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to prosecute Miss Pheto and others who have been implicated in stealing from the poor.
