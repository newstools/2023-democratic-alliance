The Democratic Alliance (DA) sends our heartfelt congratulations to the South African women’s national cricket team on reaching the final of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup for the very first time in history. The South African women’s national cricket team were beaten by the Australians by 19 runs in the final. The South African women’s national cricket team reached the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup for the very first time, a remarkable feat and one that is even more phenomenal as it all unfolded on South African soil. This phenomenal achievement comes at a time when South Africa is at the edge of the precipice —a nation reeling from deep divisions and in desperate need of a renewed sense of togetherness. The ICC Women’s T20 World Cup has been a highly anticipated event for South Africans and we thank the team for once again reminding the nation that we are indeed #AlwaysRising and of our shared commitment to building a stronger South Africa for all. The South African women’s national cricket team have reinvigorated and revived our collective pride for our young nation and have shown us what can be achieved when we all pull together to attain a common goal. The DA would like to congratulate Australia on winning the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup, they displayed great professionalism, athleticism and competed in a manner that their whole nation can be proud of. Congratulation once again to the South African women’s national cricket team. Their performance throughout the tournament truly transcends the sports field and is an important tool that we can use towards building South Africa to what we all know she can be – a beautiful nation that stands together with all South Africans who share a community of values embodied by freedom, fairness, opportunity and diversity.
