The DA Leader, John Steenhuisen, today submitted our Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) application to obtain all information and evidence at Eskom’s disposal regarding the alleged ANC kingpin behind the systemic corruption that has brought our country’s electricity supply to its knees. The DA calls on Eskom management to comply with our PAIA request so that the people of South Africa may finally know the full truth about the ANC puppet-masters behind the collapse of Eskom.
