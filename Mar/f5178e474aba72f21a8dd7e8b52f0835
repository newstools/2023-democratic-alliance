Please find attached a soundbite by Manny de Freitas MP. It appears that South African Tourism (SAT) is adamant about pushing through the Tottenham Hotspur R1 billion sponsorship deal despite all stakeholders objecting to it. The new Minister of Tourism, Patricia de Lille must unequivocally and unambiguously reject this proposal in every way. Instead, De Lille should re-direct these funds to much-needed dilapidated tourism infrastructure throughout the country. The fact that the deadline for the DAâ€™s PAIA application about this deal lapsed yesterday and no response was received from SAT, raises even more red flags. I am assuming that the reason that SAT has not responded to our PAIA request is that there is something to hide. As there has been no reply by SAT to my request, I will be making an appeal for this information. De Lille has an opportunity to show South Africans that she is different and opposite from her no-substance glitz and glamour predecessor by fixing this issue and ensuring that this money is put to better use. In so doing, De Lille will be ensuring that our tourism numbers will grow particularly in lesser-known parts of the country so that more on-the-ground opportunities and job creation takes place at these tourism sites and areas.
