The DA whilst acknowledging the legitimate election of a new Executive Mayor in the City of Tshwane, condemns the underhanded dealings by which the ANC-EFF coalition of corruption and chaos recaptured control of the City. The DA has fought for South Africans from opposition benches before today. A DA opposition is an ANC-EFF government’s worst nightmare. We will make the ANC-EFF coalition of chaos and corruption regret today’s shameless politicking to achieve through the backdoor what voters have denied them at the ballot box: the power to loot and leech whilst South Africans languish. Parties in the Tshwane City Council today showed their true colours. The DA voted for Cilliers Brink to lead the Multi-Party Coalition in government. This was a vote for service delivery to residents, clean governance, and fiscal prudence. Unfortunately, other political parties put self-interest, patronage, and political opportunism above the people of Tshwane. That today’s capture of local government was made possible by unaccountable minor political parties, vulnerable to the patronage and pressure of the coalition of corruption, drives home the urgent necessity for shoring up our country’s democracy through fair and reasonable thresholds for election to public offices. The reality is dawning with painful clarity: South Africans face a choice between growth and corruption, delivery and thuggery, service or self-interest, the DA way or the ANC-EFF way.
