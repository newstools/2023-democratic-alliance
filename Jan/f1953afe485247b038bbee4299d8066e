The DA is calling on the Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, to take the public into her confidence regarding the progress of the investigation into the matric cheating scandal that reportedly involved teachers and learners in Mpumalanga last year. We further call on her to release a report on the findings of the investigation before Thursday 19 January. It is extremely disheartening that unscrupulous teachers and learners would jeopardise the integrity of the matric examinations and cast aspersions on the efforts of the vast majority of learners who have faced immense challenges to study and prepare for the exams. It is time the Minister paid serious attention to the DA’s suggestion of an independent school monitoring evaluation authority to evaluate and monitor teachers. South African learners already face enormous odds regarding the quality of teaching they receive and unprincipled educators should not be allowed to further endanger learners’ futures. Already South Africa has a significant drop out rate with only 58% of learners reaching grade 12, and at least 22% of grade 11’s dropping out before their final year. This according to a written parliamentary answer by the Minister in 2022. South African learners deserve to know that the Department of Basic Education has taken the cheating scandal seriously and know the consequence management for those individuals found guilty. Young people have an uphill battle as it is, with youth employment numbers rising and the perpetual rolling blackouts killing the economy. They should not have to carry the extra burden of doubt on the integrity of the matric exam.
