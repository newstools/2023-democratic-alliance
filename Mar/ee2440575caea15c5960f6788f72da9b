Note to editors: Please find attached soundbite by Dave Bryant MP. The DA welcomes the announcement of the results of the traditional linefish appeals (phase two), as part of the Fishing Rights Allocation Process (FRAP). The initial allocations did not make provision for many appeals and as a result caused unnecessary hardship. Many rights holders were “excluded” through a process that for some was overly formalistic. The impact that this delayed process has had on many fisherfolk has been devastating and some have had to retrench employees and shut down their businesses while their boats have remained in dock. The DA has been advocating strongly throughout the process that the rights of traditional fisherfolk, many of whom have fished for generations, must be protected at all costs. We will now await the finalisation of the process over the coming months and will keep a keen eye on developments. The next phases will include tuna and hake, as well as numerous appeals in the sardine and anchovy categories.
