Note to editors: Please find attached soundbite by Kevin Mileham MP. With Cabinet scheduled to deliberate and take a decision on the proposed declaration of a State of Disaster (SoD) on the load shedding crisis, the DA is taking practical steps to ensure that such a declaration has in-built safeguards to prevent executive overreach and stop corruption. To prevent the feeding frenzy that characterized PPE procurement by ANC cadres and their families during the Covid-19 SoD, the DA will fight to ensure that any SoD on the load shedding crisis is actively monitored through a: Following the official announcement of the SoD, as provided for in the Disaster Management Act, the DA will table a proposal to the Minister of Finance, Enoch Godongwana, calling for the creation of a Special Inspector-General to prevent corruption relating to any funding directed towards addressing the electricity crisis. This Inspector-General will have broad, sweeping powers to investigate and take pre-emptive, real-time action to prevent corruption at every level of government where taxpayer money is directed towards the crisis. The DA will specifically propose that the Special Inspector-General have the following powers: The Inspector-General would differ from the Auditor-General (AG) in that the AG only considers spending after it has happened at the end of a financial year, and cannot take any preemptive action to prevent corruption. Similarly, as soon the as the SoD is announced, the DA will immediately ask Parliament to establish an ad-hoc committee that will act as an oversight mechanism to prevent executive overreach, stop corruption and enforce transparency and accountability during implementation. The DAâ€™s three point plan to place deterrents against corruption in an SoD on the load shedding crisis is to ensure that every single cent meant for addressing the electricity crisis is directed towards its intended purpose and not corrupt politicians and their friends.
