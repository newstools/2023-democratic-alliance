Threats of violence, intimidation, and vandalism by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) ahead of the party’s planned national shutdown place the wellbeing of South Africa’s limping economy at peril, and the lives and livelihoods of the South African people at grave risk. Law-abiding citizens cannot be forced to sacrifice their businesses, income, and their children’s education at the altar of EFF thuggery. If the ANC national government will not intervene, then the Democratic Alliance will. Tomorrow, Tuesday 14 March 2023, DA Federal Leader, John Steenhuisen will announce urgent legal steps against the EFF’s national shutdown, as well as a mechanism to empower South African citizens to hold any EFF member accountable for any and all damage inflicted upon public and private property. John Steenhuisen will be joined by DA National Security Advisor, Natasha Mazzone, DA Shadow Minister of Defence, Kobus Marais, and DA National Spokesperson, Solly Malatsi. The details are: Date: Tuesday 14 March 2023 Time: 10:15 Venue: Room M24, Marks Building, National Parliament
