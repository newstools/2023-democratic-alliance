The DA is preparing to submit a request in terms of the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) to obtain and expose proof that newly-appointed Minister for Public Service and Administration, Noxolo Kiviet, committed degree fraud at the University of Fort Hare. In a sworn affidavit submitted by the university to the SIU as part of its ongoing investigation into the degree mill at Fort Hare, it emerged that Kiviet fraudulently enrolled for honours and master’s degrees without having the undergraduate degreed required for enrolment. Instead, she was only in possession of a matric certificate and “a non-credit bearing short-course certificate with handwritten results.” It appears that Kiviet is following in the footsteps of Murunwa Makwarele, the disgraced former Cope councillor who was caught out for submitting a fraudulent document to claim that he was not an unrehabilitated insolvent shortly after being elected mayor by the ANC and EFF. In this case, Kiviet has been found out for alleged fraudulent enrolment at Fort Hare. It is yet another indictment on Ramaphosa that he has not only appointed one of the biggest, most bloated and most expensive Cabinets on earth, but that he has packed his executive with incompetents and malcontents. Ministers like Gwede Mantashe and Zizi Kodwa face serious allegations of corruption emanating from the Zondo Commission, and now Kiviet has been exposed as an alleged fraudster. Reform of Kiviet’s Department of Public Service and Administration is vital in order to end cadre deployment corruption, reduce the public sector wage bill and end labour violence. The DA has absolutely no confidence that an exposed fraudster can fulfil these critical responsibilities. That is why we are working to expose the full truth behind Kiviet’s alleged fraud, for which she must be held swiftly accountable.
