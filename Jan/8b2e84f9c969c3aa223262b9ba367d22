Note to editors: Please find attached soundbite by Darren Bergman MP. The DA calls on the Minister of International Relations, Naledi Pandor, to not meet with the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, unless it is to persuade Russia to cease all military operations in Ukraine. The South African government’s recent actions, including permitting the Russian cargo ship the Lady-R, to come into our shore shows that it is biased. It is becoming increasingly clear that the South African government is openly siding with Russia – as also proven by their refusal to reject the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Not only is Russia sending their navy for war games to SA, their Foreign Minister will be hosted in Pretoria by the South African government. The DA contends that a friendly engagement between the two countries is not appropriate unless it includes a discussion of how to persuade Russia to end its involvement in Ukraine as soon as possible and/or to stop using South Africa as a staging area for ships and cargo in order to sabotage our application for an IMF loan. It is not just out of touch with its people or region, but also with the rest of the world, and any additional meetings that the government would like to have with Russia at this time could have very negative economic repercussions. The DA will continue to hold government accountable. We implore the ANC government to place the rights of people above government relations and interest.
