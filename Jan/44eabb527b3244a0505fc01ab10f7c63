Today the DA filed our court papers in our application to the High Court of South Africa for an interdict to stop the implementation of an 18.65% tariff increases by National Energy Regulator (NERSA). Download the founding affidavit. The DA rejects this astronomical increase, we reject constant load shedding and we reject the government’s poor response – and President Cyril Rampahosa’s lack of response – to the biggest crisis our country has faced in the history of our democracy. It has become clear that government will not act in the interests of the citizens of this country, including protecting them from blackouts and unaffordable electricity tariffs, unless compelled by a court of law to do so. In addition to our court action, the DA will march to Luthuli House on Wednesday 25 January. This Power To The People march is directed at the ANC whose corruption and policy of cadre deployment is directly responsible for the energy crisis that we find ourselves in.
